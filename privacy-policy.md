- ONC HTI-1 Decision Support Intervention (DSI) Transparency Rule (2024)

## 2. Information We Collect
We minimize collection to protect your privacy.

| **Account Info** | Optional email or phone number to create a profile or retrieve logs. | Legitimate interest; secure access |
| **App Interactions** | Coping exercise selections, self-reflections, and AI chat entries. | Consent; continuity of care |

GroundLink AI does **not** collect Social Security numbers, financial data, or precise geolocation without consent.

## 3. How We Use Your Information
- Deliver personalized coping exercises and journaling features.  
- Detect high-risk language and display crisis resources (988, 911).  
- Improve safety, fairness, and inclusivity of AI responses.  
- Maintain legally required audit trails for transparency and safety.  
- Provide access to your prior activity logs upon request.  

We **never sell or share** data with advertisers, data brokers, or unrelated third parties.

## 4. AI Transparency and Audit Trail
We use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) hosted in a HIPAA-compliant environment (e.g., OpenAI via Azure). Each AI suggestion includes explainability metadata (source guideline and date); every session logs timestamp, prompt hash, skill delivered, and safety flags. Logs are retained **7 years**, encrypted at rest and in transit.

## 5. Data Security
- AES-256 encryption at rest; TLS 1.3 in transit.  
- No third-party trackers on authenticated pages.  
- Role-based access; least-privilege architecture.  
- Continuous vulnerability scanning; quarterly HIPAA audits.  
- Data centers meet SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, and HIPAA Security Rule.

## 6. Your Rights
You may request to access/export, delete, or correct your data; withdraw consent for future AI analysis; and receive disclosure of how AI influenced recommendations. Email **privacy@groundlink.ai**. We respond within 30 days per HIPAA and state law.

## 7. Crisis Handling and Safety
If your message indicates imminent risk, we immediately display crisis resources (988, 911), temporarily disable coaching responses, and log the event with minimal data.

## 8. Data Retention and Disposal
- Session data: retain **7 years** (or per state law).  
- De-identified analytics: retained indefinitely.  
- Deletion requests: processed within **30 days**.  
- Disposal: NIST SP 800-88 media sanitization.

## 9. Third-Party Processors
Only Business Associates under HIPAA BAA (e.g., Microsoft Azure/OpenAI for model hosting, an email vendor for transactional messages). No PHI leaves the protected environment.

## 10. Children’s Privacy
Intended for users **16+**. If under 16, use with parental/guardian consent.

## 11. Updates
Material changes will be announced in-app and may require re-consent.
