## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using GroundLink AI (“the App,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use and our [Privacy Policy](./privacy-policy.md).  
If you do not agree, do not use the App.

GroundLink AI is **not a substitute for therapy, diagnosis, or medical treatment**. It is an educational, self-help platform that provides trauma-informed coping exercises and resources for emotional regulation.

## 2. Purpose and Scope

GroundLink AI is designed for adults and older teens (16+) seeking support for stress, trauma recovery, and emotional regulation.  
The App may provide exercises such as grounding, breathing retraining, progressive muscle relaxation, or journaling prompts — none of which constitute psychotherapy or medical advice.

If you are in crisis or thinking about harming yourself, call or text **988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline)** or **911** in the U.S., or use local emergency services.

## 4. No Clinical or Emergency Care Relationship

GroundLink AI **does not create a patient-provider or therapist-client relationship**.  
The App does not diagnose, treat, or prescribe. Always consult a qualified professional for medical or mental-health concerns.

If you disclose intent to harm yourself or others, the system may display 988 resources or temporarily disable interaction. No real-time monitoring or emergency intervention occurs.
